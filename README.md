This is a single page website that contains HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, and Bootstrap. This website displays my recent projects in Github which uses the Model View Controller boilerplate with Node.js, handlebars, express.js. The projects have links to deployed the website and the pseudocode from Github. I have created a resume icon to display my resume. Please check out my website. Contact me if you have any questions.
